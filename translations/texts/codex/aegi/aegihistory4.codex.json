As the surviving nations' food supplies started to run out, they turned to war to fight over what little food remained. In 245 BA, the spaceships lost contact with Home Command on Terra.\n\nExactly what happened to the surviving nations is unknown, but it is assumed that mankind on Terra drove itself into extinction during the events following the asteroid's impact."
