      "Chs": "...其结局是大规模的全球灾荒和严重资源短缺。 幸存国家的粮食供应开始用尽时，他们转向战争以争夺剩余的少量食物。 在245 BA，飞船与泰拉的家园指挥部失去了联系。\n\n幸存的国家到底发生了什么事，还不得而知，但据推测，泰拉上的人类在小行星撞击事件后自行灭绝了。",
      "Eng": "The result was massive global starvation and a great shortage of resources. As the surviving nations' food supplies started to run out, they turned to war to fight over what little food remained. In 245 BA, the spaceships lost contact with Home Command on Terra.\n\nExactly what happened to the surviving nations is unknown, but it is assumed that mankind on Terra drove itself into extinction during the events following the asteroid's impact."

      "Eng": "^orange;Chapter 3 - Arrival^reset;\n\nThe planet looked surprisingly much like Terra: a blue marble with lush green continents and familiar white clouds. Scans of the planet and its atmosphere revealed an even greater likeness to Terra, with a breathable atmosphere, and an atmospheric pressure and gravity only slightly higher than that of Terra."

The Endurance Company, however, arrived at its destination system in 1 BA, with 19 of its 21 ships remaining. The ships continued on their way towards PT167089-06, and arrived at the planet in 0 AA (After Arrival)."
