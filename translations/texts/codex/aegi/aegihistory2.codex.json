      "Eng": "After the failure of Operation Guardian, Operation Exodus remained as humanity's last hope, and work on the project was greatly accelerated.\n\nOperation Exodus was a multinational project that had all the participating nations' space agencies cooperate in the construction of a large number of spaceships. These spaceships would be sent out to look for a new home for mankind."

      "Eng": "Unfortunately, the small time frame and the fact that spaceship development was still in early stages meant that the spaceships produced by Operation Exodus functioned less than optimally.\n\nA grand total of 42 ships was eventually built and ready for launch. Each ship would carry a crew of 1000, which included scientists, engineers and people selected for their genetic superiority."
