      "Chs": "一架太空梭被制造出来预计送往小行星，它将安装大量的离子推进器，以改变小行星的轨迹并使之远离地球。然而计划失败，运载推进器的太空梭在发射过程中故障，导致其在起飞后不久爆炸。该行动方案报废，使方案“出埃及记计划”成为人类的最后手段。",
      "Eng": "A space shuttle was built to be sent to the asteroid, where it would install large numbers of ion thrusters intended to change the asteroid's trajectory and steer it away from Earth. The operation failed, however, when the shuttle carrying the thrusters suffered a malfunction during the launch sequence which caused it to explode shortly after take-off. The operation was scrapped, leaving Operation Exodus as mankind's last resort."

The estimated date of impact was only months away, giving mankind only a small window of time to prepare. Two projects were almost immediately started: Operation Guardian and Operation Exodus.\n\nOperation Guardian was an attempt to deflect the asteroid and bring it off course."
