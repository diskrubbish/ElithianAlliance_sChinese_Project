The operation failed, however, when the shuttle carrying the thrusters suffered a malfunction during the launch sequence which caused it to explode shortly after take-off. The operation was scrapped, leaving Operation Exodus as mankind's last resort."

The estimated date of impact was only months away, giving mankind only a small window of time to prepare. Two projects were almost immediately started: Operation Guardian and Operation Exodus.\n\nOperation Guardian was an attempt to deflect the asteroid and bring it off course."
