      "Chs": "由于其稀有性和不可预测性，埃癸人技术很少使用湖仙碎片（Xanafian），但是埃维里军备（Aeviri Armaments）能够使用此类碎片制作出出色的装备。 碎片放置在武器的中心，可以在武器的整长上最佳地布散能量。 武器握柄中的直观压力传感器令使用者可以激活武器的两种模式之一:“进攻”或“防御”。",
      "Eng": "Aeginian technology rarely utilizes Xanafian Shards due to their rarity and unpredictability, but Aeviri Armaments was able to craft exceptional gear using such shards. The shard was set in the center of the weapon, where its energy could be best distributed across the weapon's length. An intuitive pressure sensor in the weapon's grip allowed the user to activate one of two modes on the weapon: Offence or Defence."

      "Chs": "在进攻模式下，湖仙碎片会在锋刃上投射一层能量，赋予它奇异而明亮的辉光，这将有力撕裂任何被该武器所击中的分子。 在防御模式下，能量将投射在武器的整体长度上，从而增强其防御能力。 每次充能状态的护盾被击中，它都会释放出一股能量，破坏并击退任何落于其上的物质。",
      "Eng": "In Offence Mode, the Xanafian Shard would project a layer of energy over the blade, granting it a strange, bright glow that would help tear apart the molecules of whatever the weapon would strike. In Defence Mode, the energy would be projected across the length of the weapon, enhancing its defensive capabilities. Every time the energized shield was struck, it would release a burst of energy that damages and knocks back whatever landed the blow."

They were shieldblades of exceptional make, hand-crafted using the highest-quality allosteel for a lightweight yet extremely resilient blade. Their defining feature, however, was the Xanafian Shard that powered them."
