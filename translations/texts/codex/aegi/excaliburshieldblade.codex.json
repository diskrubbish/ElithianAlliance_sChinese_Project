The shard was set in the center of the weapon, where its energy could be best distributed across the weapon's length. An intuitive pressure sensor in the weapon's grip allowed the user to activate one of two modes on the weapon: Offence or Defence."

Every time the energized shield was struck, it would release a burst of energy that damages and knocks back whatever landed the blow."

They were shieldblades of exceptional make, hand-crafted using the highest-quality allosteel for a lightweight yet extremely resilient blade. Their defining feature, however, was the Xanafian Shard that powered them."
