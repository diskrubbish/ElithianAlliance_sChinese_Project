In the meantime, I think I may start working on my next weapon. I had a concept for a plasma-infused projectile that releases some of its energy whenever it hits a hard surface. If I can get it to work with the ricocheting projectiles made by my brother, I think this weapon could cause quite the mayhem on the battlefield."
