      "Eng": "Over time, the settlers of Creon City managed to start peaceful interactions with the Dremeton, using variations on sign language for communication. In 30 AA, the settlers of Creon City had started learning the Dremetonian language, and started teaching the tribe the English language in return.\n\nThe Dremeton started referring to the settlers as Aegi, their word for \"friend\" or \"ally\". The name stuck, and the settlers eventually started calling themselves Aegi as well."

In 78 AA, the Dremeton tribes and the Aeginian Union agreed upon a common set of laws - the Elithian Code - which would later form the basis of the Elithian Alliance."

The settlers would be known as Aegi from that point onwards, and the two cities would form a federal nation with semi-independent governments."
