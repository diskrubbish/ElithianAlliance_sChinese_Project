In 30 AA, the settlers of Creon City had started learning the Dremetonian language, and started teaching the tribe the English language in return.\n\nThe Dremeton started referring to the settlers as Aegi, their word for \"friend\" or \"ally\". The name stuck, and the settlers eventually started calling themselves Aegi as well."

The settlers would be known as Aegi from that point onwards, and the two cities would form a federal nation with semi-independent governments."
