The impact event destroyed several Human nations at once, and caused massive problems for the surviving nations. The impact swept up a layer of dust that would cover the entire planet and blot out the sun for several years, causing massive harvest failures and killing off many species of plants and animals."

This planet was also believed to be potentially habitable, but there were no guarantees: readings of PT167089-06 showed promise, but they could not tell humanity of the exact conditions on the planet."

The ships had been divided into two groups set for different destinations."
