      "Eng": "It took much time and more resources, but in the end the Avikan emerged victorious. The Thelean invaders were defeated and driven off Kadavan, but the Avikan nation was in shambles. It took years to rebuild, and when the second invasion came, we had only just recovered from the first. The year was 212 BF, when another small army of Thelean invaders arrived on our planet."

      "Eng": "Luckily, the Avikan were now better prepared for an alien assault, and the force that attacked was smaller than the first. After its defeat, we learned what the invaders were really after: the ruins and artefacts of the Old Ones. The Theleans were raiding our world to get their hands on these ancient relics, the relics of our Uplifters."

      "Eng": "The Era of Vhelin lasted for over a millennium, until the First Thelean Invasion of 241 BF. The first contact the Avikan had with an alien species was brutal. The Theleans came out of nowhere, assaulting Terves across Kadavan and laying ruin to the Avikan nation."
