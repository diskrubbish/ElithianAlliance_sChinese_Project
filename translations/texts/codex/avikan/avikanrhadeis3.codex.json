      "Chs": "祂告诉我们，祂的名字叫日海狄斯，尽管祂是驻扎在卡达文（Kadavan）的森天族（Ce'Tennan——我们称为古者们）的领导人，但祂并不孤单。 祂邀请我们的祖先进入内城，开启我们曾经永远无法打开的穹隆之所（Vault），然后祂消失了。",
      "Eng": "He told us that his name was Rhadeis, and that he was not alone, although he was the leader of the Ce'Tennan, who we know as the Old Ones, stationed on Kadavan. He invited our ancestors into the inner city, unlocking the vault doors that we could never have opened ourselves, and then he vanished."

      "Chs": "在接下来的几个世纪中，我们的祖先研究了瓦司·瓦哈'雷赫（Vas Vha'leih）及其中的遗物，并根据研究成果开发了我们今天所使用的许多技术。 瓦哈'雷罕战争（Vha'leihan War）和随后的连串圣城逃难（Exodus）之后，这项研究变得缓慢而困难，因为战争破坏了这座古城的大部分，几乎没人有胆量返回那里。",
      "Eng": "Over the next few centuries, our ancestors would study Vas Vha'leih and its artefacts, and they developed many of the technologies we use today based on their research. After the Vha'leihan War and the subsequent Exodus from Vas Vha'leih, this research became slow and difficult, as the war damaged much of the ancient city, and few dared return there."

      "Eng": "Sometime during their stay at the Seat of Dhas, it is said that Rhadeis appeared before our ancestors, and that he spoke to us in an alien language that we somehow understood. He told our ancestors that this city, called Vas Vha'leih, was once his home, and that from it, he had guided our race's development since before we were even Avikan."
