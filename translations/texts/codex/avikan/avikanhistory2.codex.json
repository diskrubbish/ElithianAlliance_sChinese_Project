      "Chs": "圣城的科登们很长一段时间都生活在和平与繁荣中，但这一切并不持久。 在约2150 BF时，人口达到了临界水平。 物资短缺，空间用尽，人们开始骚动。 结果就是瓦哈'雷罕之战，这是阿威坎历史上的第一次大规模内战。 它破坏了科登居民的人口值，并摧毁了这座城市的大部分地区。 最后，科登们被迫大批逃离这座城市。",
      "Eng": "For a long time, the Khoden of Vas Vha'leih lived in peace and prosperity, but this would not last. Around 2150 BF, the population reached a critical level. Supplies fell short and space ran out, and the people began to riot. The result was the Vha'leihen War, the first large civil war in Avikan history. It ravaged the Khoden population and destroyed much of the city. In the end, the Khoden were forced to abandon the city in a great exodus."

      "Chs": "圣城（Vas Vha'leih）的科登（Khoden）在他们的古代都市繁荣了起来，并研究了古者遗留下的许多工艺品。 有关日海狄斯的宗教日海地，据信正是在这里起源的，不过前人之述备矣，围绕该主题的著作已经有了整部。 我们的大多数现代技术都是基于在圣城之类的地方发现的旧工艺品，而我们族群的迅速发展也归功于他们所留下的一切。",
      "Eng": "The Khoden of Vas Vha'leih prospered in their ancient city, and took to studying the many artefacts left behind by the Old Ones. This is where the Rhaiod, the religion of Rhadeis, is believed to have originated, but there are entire volumes written on that subject. Most of our modern technologies are based on the Old Ones' artefacts found in places like Vas Vha'leih, and the quick development of our people is thanks to what they left behind."

      "Chs": "此处就是科登们分离的地方。 许多团体前往遥远的山脉并在那里建立新的家园，而其他团体则返回沙漠以恢复游牧的生活方式。 那最后一批人与一小群从未听说过圣城的牧民们一起，被称为诺曼·游牧民。",
      "Eng": "This is where the Khoden split up. Many groups travelled to distant mountain ranges and built new homes there, while other groups returned to the desert to reassume a nomadic way of life. These last groups joined up with the small groups of nomads that never knew of Vas Vha'leih, and became known as the Nomen, the nomads."
