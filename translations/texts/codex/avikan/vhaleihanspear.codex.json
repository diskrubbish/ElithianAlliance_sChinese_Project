      "Chs": "瓦哈'雷罕长矛（Vha'leihan Spears）是人们最常称呼它们的名字，它们是大约2500年前定居在圣都的人所制造的武器。 这些长矛是由卡凡尼特（Kavanite）铸造的（就像今天大多数武器一样），但是具有一个真正使它们与众不同的特征：它们镶嵌有湖仙碎片，这赋予了长矛不可预测但不可思议的力量。 矛的制造方式以及它们的运作方式，尚不得而知-知识在瓦哈'雷罕战争中亡佚了，就像其他许多东西一样。",
      "Eng": "Vha'leihan Spears, as they are most often called, are weapons created by those who settled in Vas Vha'leih some 2500 years ago. The spears were made of Kavanite - like most weapons still are today - but had one feature that truly set them apart: they were inlaid with a shard of the Xanafir, which gave the spears unpredictable but incredible powers. How the spears were made, and how exactly they functioned, is unknown - the knowledge was lost in the Vha'leihan War, like so much else."

      "Chs": "湖仙碎片在那时更为普遍，因为圣城拥有大量的水晶制品。 诺玛达仍然有许多碎片存储在金库等地中，但是无论要将碎片融入哪种武器建构中，都远远超出了当今技术的可能性。 但是，我们仍然拥有一些瓦哈'雷罕长矛，它们被普遍认为是迷失的瓦哈'雷罕时代最珍贵的工艺品。",
      "Eng": "Xanafian shards were far more common back then, as Vas Vha'leih held a vast store of the crystalline artefacts. The Nomada still has many shards stored away in vaults and the like, but to place a shard in nearly every weapon built is well beyond what is possible nowadays. There are, however, still some Vha'leihan Spears in our possession, and they are generally regarded as some of the most precious artefacts of the lost Vha'leihan Era."
