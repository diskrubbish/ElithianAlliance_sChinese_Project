      "Eng": "While most artefacts were simply found, the first few artefacts our ancient ancestors acquired are said to have been given to them directly by one of the Old Ones. Our ancestors took this as a sign that a divine creature, Rhadeis, then known simply as Dhas, or God, looked over us and that he created not only the artefacts, but the world and ourselves as well."
