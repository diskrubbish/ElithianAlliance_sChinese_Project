      "Chs": "在道登战争之前和在此期间，“军团”是一支仅由道登战机组成的强大军事力量。 军团的标志性武器是“军团之刃”：即使身处战火中也可以迅速转换成能量步枪的变形刀剑。 变刃背后的设计理念很简单：减少道登军队建设的资源成本。 变刃的制造比剑或常规步枪更耗时，但与分开的剑和步枪相比，它们需要的资源更少。",
      "Eng": "Before and during the Droden War, the Legion was a great military force consisting solely of Droden warframes. The Legion's signature weapon was the Legion Blade: a switchblade that could be transformed into an energy rifle even in the heat of combat. The idea behind the switchblades was simple: to reduce resource costs for the construction of the Droden army. While a switchblade is more time-consuming to build than either a sword or a conventional rifle, they required fewer resources than a seperate sword and rifle would."
