      "Eng": "Although all the discoveries about Rhadeis made him look less like a god to many, for he is, or perhaps was, a mortal Ce'Tennan, his actions have made him more than a god to many more. He did not create us, but he did guide us, and without him, we would not be alive today."

      "Chs": "每天，都有关于奇迹事件的新报道，以及目击日海狄斯的异象为人们的梦想提供着支持。 古者的技术使任何距离的交流成为可能，而且它们的文物有时也会对人们的思想产生奇怪的影响，因此或许，日海狄斯，实际上，是跃过空间...甚至，穿越时间，与我们交流。",
      "Eng": "Every day, there are new reports of miracular events, and of visions of Rhadeis offering support in people's dreams. The technology of the Old Ones makes communication over any distance possible, and their artefacts sometimes have strange effects on people's minds, so perhaps Rhadeis is, in fact, communicating with us through space, or perhaps, through time."
