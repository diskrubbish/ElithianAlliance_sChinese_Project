      "Chs": "出埃及的后几年，科登们定居在许多山脉中，并在石头上建造了大城市，称之特惟（Terves）。 科登的每个团体都组成了自己的国家，有时科登会在彼此之间发动战争。 人民分裂了，国家之间也很少合作。 直到1372 BF，伟大的伊利亚拉特·安德·弗赫林（Ilyalat ande Vhelin）在弗赫林的特惟开始掌权。",
      "Eng": "In the years following the exodus, the Khoden settled in many mountain ranges and built great cities, known as Terves, in the stone. Each group of Khoden formed a nation of its own, and at times the Khoden would war amongst each other. The people were divided, and there was little cooperation between nations. That was until 1372 BF, when the great Ilyalat ande Vhelin rose to power in the Terve of Vhelin."

      "Eng": "While the Nomen never joined the Khoden, cooperation between the groups became a given. The Khoden would provide the Nomen with technologies to help them thrive in the open desert, while the Nomen brought back rare resources from the deep desert in exchange. An era of peace and prosperity had arrived for the Avikan people."
