Each group of Khoden formed a nation of its own, and at times the Khoden would war amongst each other. The people were divided, and there was little cooperation between nations. That was until 1372 BF, when the great Ilyalat ande Vhelin rose to power in the Terve of Vhelin."

An era of peace and prosperity had arrived for the Avikan people."
