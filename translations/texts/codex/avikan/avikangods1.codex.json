They go by many names: the Old Ones, the Uplifters, the Centens, or the Ce'Tennan are just a few well-known examples. The first two of these names are products of Avikan culture, while the term \"Centens\" is the most universally accepted name. Ce'Tennan, however, is likely the name that most resembles what the creatures called themselves."

The study and reverse-engineering of these relics taught our people the secrets behind efficient interstellar travel, anti-gravity fields, jumpgate technology and even holographic displays. There are also legends of direct interaction with one of the creatures - Rhadeis - which form the basis of the Rhaiod religion."
