Supplies fell short and space ran out, and the people began to riot. The result was the Vha'leihen War, the first large civil war in Avikan history. It ravaged the Khoden population and destroyed much of the city. In the end, the Khoden were forced to abandon the city in a great exodus.",

This is where the Rhaiod, the religion of Rhadeis, is believed to have originated, but there are entire volumes written on that subject. Most of our modern technologies are based on the Old Ones' artefacts found in places like Vas Vha'leih, and the quick development of our people is thanks to what they left behind.",
