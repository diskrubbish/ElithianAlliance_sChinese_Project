The Legion's signature weapon was the Legion Blade: a switchblade that could be transformed into an energy rifle even in the heat of combat. The idea behind the switchblades was simple: to reduce resource costs for the construction of the Droden army. While a switchblade is more time-consuming to build than either a sword or a conventional rifle, they required fewer resources than a seperate sword and rifle would.",
