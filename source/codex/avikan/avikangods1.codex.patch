They go by many names: the Old Ones, the Uplifters, the Centens, or the Ce'Tennan are just a few well-known examples. The first two of these names are products of Avikan culture, while the term \"Centens\" is the most universally accepted name. Ce'Tennan, however, is likely the name that most resembles what the creatures called themselves.",

There are also legends of direct interaction with one of the creatures - Rhadeis - which form the basis of the Rhaiod religion.",
